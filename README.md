# AI-ML-Powered-Stock-Prediction-Portfolio-Rebalancing


This project focuses on predicting stock market trends and optimizing portfolio rebalancing using advanced AI-ML techniques. The system leverages an LSTM-based model for stock market prediction and integrates a Market Mood Indicator powered by Generative AI to analyze market sentiment and dynamically adjust investments. The solution helps users save **10-25%** of their portfolio value by making data-driven decisions based on real-time market conditions.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Market Prediction

#### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Fetching Dataset**: The dataset is fetched from Yahoo Finance using a defined start date.
- **Visualizing Closing Price**: The closing price of the stock is plotted to understand historical trends.
- **Moving Averages**: 
  - Calculated and plotted **100-day** and **200-day** moving averages.
  - Compared the two moving averages to identify long-term trends.

#### Dataset Preparation
- **Splitting Dataset**: The dataset is split into **70% training** and **30% testing** sets.
- **Normalization**: Applied **MinMax Scaler** to normalize the dataset for better model performance.

#### LSTM Model
- **Model Architecture**: Built an LSTM model with multiple layers to capture temporal dependencies in the data.
- **Training**: Trained the model on the training dataset to learn patterns and trends.
- **Testing**: Used the last **100 columns** of the training dataset to predict the **1st column** of the testing dataset.

#### Evaluation
- **Prediction vs Actual**: Plotted a graph comparing predicted and actual stock prices.
- **Model Metrics**:
  - Calculated **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** to measure prediction accuracy.
  - Computed **R2 Score** to evaluate the model's performance.

### 2. Market Mood Indicator
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilized Generative AI to analyze market sentiment from news, social media, and other sources.
- **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Integrated the sentiment analysis with the LSTM model to dynamically adjust investments.
- **Savings**: The system helps users save **10-25%** of their portfolio value by optimizing investments based on real-time market conditions.
